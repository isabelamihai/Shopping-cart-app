# üõíShopping-cart-app

This app is developed as a shopping cart list via Firebase Realtime Database.
<br/>
<br/>
Enter manually an item and press "Enter" key or click "Add to cart" button The data will be saved in firebase and appear in the app. <br/>
When deleting all items double click on "DELETE ALL". This will also clear the database. <br/>
If you want to delete certains items only, click on the specific ones and they will be removed from the list and from the firebase also. <br/>

Be aware that the database URL: "https://shopping-cart-app-4f62a-default-rtdb.europe-west1.firebasedatabase.app/" is unique for every user so you have to create your own in order to code it. <br/>
